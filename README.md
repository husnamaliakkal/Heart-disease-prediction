# Ten-Year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk Predictor

Heart disease (heart disease) is a group of diseases related to cardiovascular diseases, manifested by a violation of the normal functioning of the heart. May be caused by damage to the epicardium, pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, valvular apparatus of the heart, heart vessels.Heart disease can last a long time in a latent form, clinically not manifesting itself. Along with various tumors, these diseases are today the main cause of premature death in developed countries.

The uninterrupted operation of the circulatory system, which consists of the heart as a muscle pump and a network of blood vessels, is a necessary condition for the normal functioning of the body.This project aims to predict the ten-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using data analysis and predictive modeling. The goal is to identify individuals at risk of developing CHD and facilitate early intervention and prevention efforts.

## Dataset:
The project utilizes a dataset containing columns related to health metrics and conditions, such as gender, age, smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant factors collected by  National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Framingham (USA).

## Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identified the most important predictor attributes using various techniques.
3. **Model Selection**: Explored different machine learning models for predicting CHD risk.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of each model and selected the best-performing one.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Built a reliable predictive model for CHD risk prediction.
